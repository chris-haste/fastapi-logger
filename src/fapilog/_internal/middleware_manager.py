"""Middleware management for fapilog logging components.

This module provides a dedicated MiddlewareManager class that handles
all middleware-related operations extracted from LoggingContainer and
LifecycleManager, following the single responsibility principle.

Key Features:
- FastAPI middleware registration and configuration
- httpx trace propagation setup and configuration
- Middleware-specific configuration management
- Thread-safe operations
- Clean interface for all middleware operations
- Extensible design for future middleware types
