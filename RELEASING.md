# Releasing fapilog

This document outlines the automated release process for fapilog following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Automated PyPI Publishing

Starting with the implementation of Trusted Publishing, fapilog now uses GitHub Actions to automatically publish releases to PyPI when version tags are pushed. This eliminates the need for manual uploads and API token management.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Verify all tests pass: `hatch run test:test`
- Ensure linting passes: `hatch run lint:lint`
- Verify type checking passes: `hatch run typecheck:typecheck`

## How Automated Publishing Works

The automated publishing process uses:

- **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)**: No API tokens required - PyPI trusts GitHub Actions directly
- **Version Validation**: Ensures tag version matches `pyproject.toml` version
- **Artifact Verification**: Builds and validates both wheel and source distributions
- **Automatic Triggers**: Publishes when a valid version tag is pushed

## Legacy Helper Script

For manual publishing or testing purposes, you can still use the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/publish_to_pypi.py
```

**Note**: This manual approach is no longer recommended for production releases.

## Automated Release Process

### 1. Prepare the Release

1. **Bump version in `pyproject.toml`**

   ```bash
   # Edit pyproject.toml and update the version field
   # Example: version = "0.1.0" → version = "0.2.0"
   ```

2. **Update CHANGELOG.md**

   - Move entries from `## [Unreleased]` to a new version section
   - Format: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Example:

     ```markdown
     ## [0.2.0] - 2024-01-15

     ### Added

     - New feature X
     - Enhanced feature Y

     ### Changed

     - Improved performance of Z

     ### Fixed

     - Bug fix in A
     ```

3. **Commit the changes**
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   ```

### 2. Create and Push the Release Tag

1. **Create a signed tag**

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   ```

   For a more detailed tag message linking to the changelog:

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z

   See CHANGELOG.md for detailed changes.

   https://github.com/chris-haste/fastapi-logger/blob/vX.Y.Z/CHANGELOG.md#xyz---yyyy-mm-dd"
   ```

2. **Push the tag to GitHub**

   ```bash
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

   **🚀 That's it!** The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:

   - Verify the tag version matches `pyproject.toml`
   - Build the package (both wheel and source distribution)
   - Publish to PyPI using Trusted Publishing
   - Provide build verification and upload confirmation

### 3. Verify the Release

After pushing the tag, you can:

1. **Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow**

   - Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository
   - Watch the "Publish to PyPI" workflow run
   - Verify it completes successfully

2. **Confirm PyPI publication**
   - Visit [PyPI fapilog page](https://pypi.org/project/fapilog/)
   - Verify the new version is available
   - Test installation: `pip install fapilog=={new_version}`

## Package Name

The package is published to PyPI as **`fapilog`** and is developed in the `fastapi-logger` repository.

- **PyPI Package**: `fapilog`
- **GitHub Repository**: `fastapi-logger`
- **Installation**: `pip install fapilog`
- **Source Code**: `github.com/chris-haste/fastapi-logger`

## Manual PyPI Publishing (Legacy)

This section covers the complete manual PyPI publishing process for fapilog.

#### 4.1 PyPI Account Setup

1. **Create PyPI Account**

   - Visit [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account
   - Verify your email address

2. **Create TestPyPI Account**

   - Visit [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account
   - This is for testing releases before publishing to production PyPI

3. **Generate API Token**
   - Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
   - Click "Add API token"
   - Give it a name like "fapilog-upload-token"
   - Copy the token (format: `pypi-AgEI...`)

#### 4.2 Secure Credential Storage

**Option A: Using ~/.pypirc (Recommended)**

Create `~/.pypirc` file:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi
    testpypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-AgEI...your-token-here...

[testpypi]
repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username = __token__
password = pypi-AgEI...your-test-token-here...
```

**Option B: Environment Variables**

```bash
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-AgEI...your-token-here...
```

**Option C: Interactive (Less Secure)**

```bash
# Twine will prompt for credentials
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

#### 4.3 TestPyPI Upload and Verification

1. **Upload to TestPyPI**

   ```bash
   python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
   ```

2. **Install from TestPyPI**

   ```bash
   pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ fapilog
   python -c "import fapilog; print('TestPyPI installation successful')"
   ```

3. **Verify Package Metadata**
   - Visit [TestPyPI fapilog page](https://test.pypi.org/project/fapilog/)
   - Check that description, classifiers, and URLs are correct
   - Verify version matches `pyproject.toml`

#### 4.4 Production PyPI Upload

1. **Upload to PyPI**

   ```bash
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```

2. **Verify Upload**

   ```bash
   pip install fapilog
   python -c "import fapilog; print('PyPI installation successful')"
   ```

3. **Check PyPI Page**
   - Visit [PyPI fapilog page](https://pypi.org/project/fapilog/)
   - Verify all metadata is correct
   - Check that README renders properly

#### 4.5 Troubleshooting PyPI Uploads

**Common Issues:**

1. **Package already exists**

   ```bash
   # Check if version already exists
   pip index versions fapilog

   # If version exists, bump version in pyproject.toml
   # Then rebuild and upload
   python -m build
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```

2. **Authentication errors**

   ```bash
   # Verify token is correct
   # Check ~/.pypirc file permissions (should be 600)
   chmod 600 ~/.pypirc
   ```

3. **Metadata validation errors**

   ```bash
   # Check package metadata
   python -m twine check dist/*

   # Verify pyproject.toml is valid
   python -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml', 'rb'))"
   ```

## Version Numbering

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Examples

- `v0.1.0` → `v0.1.1` (patch: bug fix)
- `v0.1.0` → `v0.2.0` (minor: new feature)
- `v0.1.0` → `v1.0.0` (major: breaking change)

## Pre-release Testing

Before creating a release tag, perform a dry-run:

1. **Create a test tag**

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z-test -m "Test release vX.Y.Z"
   ```

2. **Test the build process**

   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```

3. **Delete the test tag**
   ```bash
   git tag -d vX.Y.Z-test
   git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z-test  # Delete remote tag if pushed
   ```

## Release Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass (`hatch run test:test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`hatch run lint:lint`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`hatch run typecheck:typecheck`)
- [ ] Version bumped in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with new version section
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed to main
- [ ] Tag created and pushed
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [ ] New version visible on PyPI
- [ ] Installation test successful (`pip install fapilog=={new_version}`)

## Future Enhancements

The automated publishing process could be further enhanced with:

- Automated GitHub Releases creation
- Automated version bumping (e.g., with `bump2version` or `hatch`)
- Automated changelog generation
- Release notes generation from PRs
- Automated pre-release publishing to TestPyPI

## Troubleshooting

### Tag already exists

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d vX.Y.Z

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z

# Recreate tag
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main --tags
```

### Build fails

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- Check for syntax errors: `python -c "import fapilog"`
- Verify `pyproject.toml` is valid

### Push fails

- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Check if the tag already exists remotely
- Verify your git credentials are configured
