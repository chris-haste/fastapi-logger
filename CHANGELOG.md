  This comprehensive documentation overhaul provides enterprise-grade documentation suitable for production teams while maintaining the developer-friendly approach that makes fapilog easy to adopt and integrate.

- **Story 14.2**: Version Management Centralization

  - **NEW**: Centralized version management with single source of truth in `pyproject.toml`
  - **NEW**: Dynamic version reading in `src/fapilog/__init__.py` using `importlib.metadata`
  - **NEW**: Robust fallback mechanism to `pyproject.toml` when package metadata unavailable
  - **NEW**: Support for both `tomllib` (Python 3.11+) and `tomli` (older versions) for TOML parsing
  - **NEW**: Comprehensive unit tests (13 tests) covering all version management scenarios
  - **ENHANCED**: Eliminated version duplication between `pyproject.toml` and `__init__.py`
  - **ENHANCED**: Automatic version synchronization - no manual updates needed in `__init__.py`
  - **ENHANCED**: Works correctly in both development (editable install) and production (pip install) environments
  - **ENHANCED**: Graceful error handling for edge cases (missing metadata, import errors, file not found)
  - **TESTED**: All tests passing with comprehensive coverage of fallback scenarios and edge cases
  - **MAINTAINED**: Full backward compatibility - existing code continues to work unchanged
  - **PERFORMANCE**: Zero overhead with efficient metadata reading and minimal fallback logic

  **Technical Implementation:**

  ```python
  # Version is now automatically read from pyproject.toml
  # No manual updates needed in __init__.py
  from fapilog import __version__
  print(__version__)  # Always matches pyproject.toml
  ```

  **Fallback Behavior:**

  - Primary: Reads from package metadata via `importlib.metadata.version("fapilog")`

## [Unreleased]

- Fallback: Reads directly from `pyproject.toml` if metadata unavailable
- Final fallback: Returns "0.1.2" if all else fails

**Test Coverage:**

- Version attribute existence and format validation
- Package metadata reading in various environments
- Fallback mechanisms for all error scenarios
- Import stability and consistency testing
- Edge cases: missing files, import errors, attribute errors

This improvement eliminates version drift issues and provides a robust, maintainable version management system suitable for production use.

      metrics_enabled=True,
      metrics_prometheus_enabled=True,
      metrics_prometheus_port=8000
  )
  configure_logging(settings=settings)

  # Or via environment variables
  export FAPILOG_METRICS_ENABLED=true
  export FAPILOG_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED=true
  ```

  **Available Metrics:**

  - Queue: `fapilog_queue_size`, `fapilog_queue_enqueued_total`, `fapilog_queue_dropped_total`

  - Response body size capture via `len(response.body)` when available
  - Works for standard JSON, form, and plain requests with graceful fallback to `Content-Length` header
  - Enricher positioned after context and before final rendering in processor chain
  - Logs emitted outside HTTP context do not raise errors—fields are omitted gracefully
  - Comprehensive unit tests verifying accurate request/response size measurement for various methods
  - Tests verify enricher skips gracefully when context is missing and field values are numeric
  - Integration with existing `TraceIDMiddleware` infrastructure for context variable management
  - Fields are only added if not already present, allowing manual override of values
  - Updated README "Log Fields" section already documents `req_bytes` and `res_bytes` fields

- **Story 4.2**: Memory & CPU Snapshot Enricher

  - New `resource_snapshot_enricher` processor that adds `memory_mb` and `cpu_percent` fields to all log events
  - Memory usage capture via `psutil.Process().memory_info().rss` converted to megabytes (rounded float)
  - CPU usage capture via `psutil.Process().cpu_percent(interval=None)` as percentage (0.0-100.0)
  - Cached `psutil.Process()` object for performance optimization using `@lru_cache`
  - Optional dependency on `psutil>=5.9` via `fapilog[metrics]` package
  - Conditional inclusion based on `LoggingSettings.enable_resource_metrics` (default: False)
  - Environment variable support: `FAPILOG_ENABLE_RESOURCE_METRICS` for easy configuration
  - Graceful error handling for cases where process info cannot be retrieved (OSError, AttributeError)
  - Fields are only added if not already present, allowing manual override of values

  - Process ID capture via `os.getpid()` with caching for optimal performance
  - Fields are only added if not already present, allowing manual override of values
  - Enricher positioned early in processor chain (before redaction and rendering)
  - Zero external dependencies beyond standard library (`socket`, `os`)
  - Comprehensive unit tests covering field presence, manual override, caching, and edge cases
  - Updated README "Log Fields" section to document `hostname` and `pid` fields
  - Integration with existing processor pipeline ensuring consistent log format

- **Story 3.4**: Load Testing the Logging Queue

  - Comprehensive load testing script (`scripts/load_test_log_queue.py`) for simulating high-throughput logging scenarios
  - Configurable test parameters via CLI arguments or environment variables: concurrency, rate, duration, queue settings
  - Performance metrics tracking: total logs attempted, successfully enqueued, dropped logs, average enqueue latency
  - Support for all overflow strategies (drop, block, sample) with detailed performance reporting
  - Integration with hatch scripts: `hatch run test-queue-load` for easy execution
  - Updated README with "Benchmarking Logging Queue" section including usage examples and performance targets
  - Performance assessment with latency thresholds: <100 µs (excellent), <500 µs (good), >500 µs (poor)
  - Environment variable support for all test parameters: `LOAD_TEST_CONCURRENCY`, `LOAD_TEST_RATE`, `LOAD_TEST_DURATION`, etc.
  - Detailed test output with min/max latency, throughput analysis, and queue configuration summary
  - No external dependencies beyond `fapilog` and standard library modules

- **Story 3.3**: Queue Overflow Strategy: Drop, Block, or Sample

  - Configurable queue overflow handling via `LoggingSettings.queue_overflow` with three strategies:
    - `drop`: Silently discard logs when queue is full (default)
    - `block`: Wait for queue space before continuing (guaranteed delivery)
    - `sample`: Use probabilistic sampling when queue is full (adaptive logging)
  - Enhanced `QueueWorker.enqueue()` method to respect overflow strategy settings
  - Updated `queue_sink()` processor to handle different overflow strategies in sync contexts
  - Comprehensive unit tests for all overflow strategies with proper async/sync behavior

- **Story 3.1**: Non-Blocking In-Process Log Queue

  - Async log queue implementation using `asyncio.Queue` for non-blocking logging
  - Background `QueueWorker` coroutine that processes log events in batches
  - Graceful degradation: when queue is full, events are dropped silently to prevent blocking
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff for failed sink writes
  - Graceful shutdown via `atexit` or FastAPI `on_shutdown` handlers
  - Comprehensive unit tests verifying queue behavior, capacity limits, and non-blocking performance
  - Queue configuration via environment variables: `FAPILOG_QUEUE_ENABLED`, `FAPILOG_QUEUE_SIZE`, `FAPILOG_QUEUE_BATCH_SIZE`, etc.
  - Updated README with "Async Logging Queue" section documenting performance benefits and configuration
