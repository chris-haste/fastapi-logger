# Documentation Overhaul for ReadTheDocs - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Transform the Fapilog documentation into a developer-centric, highly navigable, and stylistically consistent resource that accelerates onboarding and supports advanced use cases.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Documentation is available but lacks structured flow, consistent style, and deep developer guidance.
- Technology stack: Sphinx/ReadTheDocs, Markdown/ReStructuredText, Python (Fapilog)
- Integration points: ReadTheDocs build system, project source code, example apps

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete overhaul of documentation structure, style, and navigation.
- How it integrates: Updates to docs/ folder, ReadTheDocs config, and example code.
- Success criteria: Documentation is clear, consistent, and enables both novice and advanced users to succeed with Fapilog.

## Stories

1. **Primer & High-Level Guide**: Create an introductory section covering "What is Fapilog?", core concepts, and typical workflows.
2. **Quickstart & Tutorials**: Develop a step-by-step tutorial guiding users from ingestion to analysis to dashboard, using real-world examples.
3. **Style & Formatting Enforcement**: Define and apply a dev-centric style guide (consistent code blocks, naming, headings, etc.).
4. **Expanded & Tested Code Snippets**: Refactor and expand code samples to be incremental, real-world, and tested.
5. **Internal Linking & Navigation**: Add callouts ("See also ..."), sidebar hierarchy, and cross-references for orientation.
6. **Decision Guides & Comparisons**: Add guides to help users choose features/services for specific use cases.
7. **Accessibility & Maintenance Improvements**: Review for accessibility, add contributor guidelines, and ensure maintainability.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Documentation build process remains compatible with ReadTheDocs
- [ ] No breaking changes to codebase
- [ ] UI/UX changes (if any) follow existing patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Disrupting current documentation usability during transition
- **Mitigation:** Use feature branches, incremental updates, and clear versioning
- **Rollback Plan:** Revert to previous documentation structure if major issues arise

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation build passes on ReadTheDocs
- [ ] Navigation and style are consistent throughout

- [ ] Internal linking and sidebar are functional
- [ ] Contributor guidelines updated
- [ ] No regression in existing documentation features

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**

- [ ] Epic can be completed in 1-3 stories maximum
- [ ] No architectural documentation is required
- [ ] Enhancement follows existing patterns
- [ ] Integration complexity is manageable

**Risk Assessment:**

- [ ] Risk to existing system is low
- [ ] Rollback plan is feasible
- [ ] Testing approach covers existing functionality
- [ ] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points

**Completeness Check:**

- [ ] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [ ] Stories are properly scoped
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Dependencies are identified

## Handoff to Story Manager

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing documentation system using Sphinx/ReadTheDocs
- Integration points: docs/ folder, ReadTheDocs config, example code
- Existing patterns to follow: Sphinx/ReadTheDocs best practices, dev-centric documentation
- Critical compatibility requirements: Docs build must not break, navigation must remain intuitive
- Each story must include verification that existing documentation remains accessible

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering a vastly improved documentation experience."
