# Story 17.1 – Audit Legacy Enricher Usage and Create Removal Plan

**Epic:** 17 – Legacy Code Removal  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 3

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a developer maintaining the codebase**  
I want a comprehensive audit of all legacy enricher usage  
So that I can create a precise removal plan without breaking any functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Complete Usage Inventory**: All usages of legacy enricher functions are documented with file locations
2. **Impact Analysis**: Each usage is categorized by impact level (critical, moderate, low)
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Dependencies between legacy and new systems are mapped
4. **Test Coverage Analysis**: All tests using legacy enrichers are identified and categorized
5. **Migration Strategy**: Detailed migration plan created for each usage category
6. **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies documented
7. **Verification Plan**: Test plan created to verify successful migration

## Tasks / Subtasks

1. **[✅] Audit Legacy Function Usage**

   - [x] Find all `register_enricher(fn)` function calls across codebase
   - [x] Document file locations and usage patterns
   - [x] Identify direct vs indirect dependencies
   - [x] Categorize by complexity (simple function vs complex logic)

2. **[✅] Audit Legacy Pipeline Integration**

   - [x] Document `run_registered_enrichers` usage in pipeline
   - [x] Map interactions with new `create_enricher_processor`
   - [x] Identify processor ordering dependencies
   - [x] Document performance impact of dual system

3. **[✅] Audit Test File Dependencies**

   - [x] Scan all test files for legacy enricher usage
   - [x] Categorize tests by type (unit, integration, example)
   - [x] Identify tests that can be easily migrated
   - [x] Identify tests requiring significant refactoring

4. **[✅] Create Migration Mapping**

   - [x] Create mapping from legacy patterns to new patterns
   - [x] Document parameter conversion requirements
   - [x] Identify cases requiring custom migration logic
   - [x] Create conversion examples for each pattern type

5. **[✅] Document Risk Mitigation**
   - [x] Identify breaking changes and their scope
   - [x] Create rollback plan for each change
   - [x] Document verification steps for each migration
   - [x] Plan incremental migration approach

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4 (Developer Agent)

### Debug Log References

- All legacy enricher tests pass: `python -m pytest tests/test_enricher_registry.py -v` ✅
- Comprehensive audit report generated: `legacy_enricher_audit_report.md`
- 47 files identified with legacy usage across source, tests, examples, docs

### Completion Notes

- **Audit Complete**: Comprehensive inventory of all 4 legacy functions completed
- **Risk Assessment**: Identified critical pipeline integration at line 162 in pipeline.py
- **Migration Plan**: Detailed 8-story sequence with effort estimates (20-30 hours total)
- **Key Finding**: Dual registry system running both legacy and new enrichers simultaneously
- **Ready for 17.2**: All preparation work completed for systematic removal

### File List

**Created:**

- `legacy_enricher_audit_report.md` - Complete audit documentation and migration plan

**Modified:**

- `docs/stories/story-17.1.md` - Updated task completion and Dev Agent Record

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-30

### Reviewed By: Agent (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Exceptional audit and planning work. The comprehensive inventory of legacy enricher usage demonstrates thorough architectural analysis. The migration plan is well-structured with realistic effort estimates and proper risk assessment.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring required - this was an audit and planning story that laid the foundation for systematic legacy removal.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Documentation follows project standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Audit report properly structured and comprehensive
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Audit methodology covered all test files and dependencies
- All ACs Met: ✓ Complete inventory, impact analysis, dependency mapping, and migration strategy delivered

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Comprehensive legacy function usage audit completed (47 files identified)
- [x] Risk assessment with mitigation strategies documented
- [x] 8-story migration sequence planned with effort estimates
- [x] Critical pipeline integration at line 162 identified
- [x] Dual registry system impact properly analyzed

### Security Review

No security concerns - audit work focused on architectural assessment.

### Performance Considerations

Audit identified dual enricher system performance overhead that subsequent stories will eliminate.

### Final Status

✓ Approved - Ready for Done

The audit work provides an excellent foundation for the systematic legacy removal in stories 17.2-17.8. The thoroughness of this analysis is evident in the quality of subsequent implementation work.
