# Story 6: Decision Guides & Comparisons

## Status

Draft

## User Story

As a user evaluating Fapilog for different use cases,
I want clear decision guides and feature comparisons,
so that I can quickly determine which Fapilog features or configurations best fit my needs and how it compares to alternatives.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: docs/user-guide.md, docs/concept.md, docs/reference.md
- Technology: Sphinx/ReadTheDocs, Markdown/ReStructuredText
- Follows pattern: Decision trees, comparison tables, use-case guides
- Touch points: Decision guide section, comparison tables, callouts

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new section provides decision guides for common use cases (e.g., "If you need X, use feature Y")
2. Feature comparison tables are included for Fapilog vs. alternatives (or between Fapilog features)
3. Guides are linked from relevant tutorials and concept sections
4. Decision guides use clear, actionable language and visuals (e.g., flowcharts)
5. Section is accessible from navigation/sidebar
