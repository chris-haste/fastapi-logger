# Story 4: Expanded & Tested Code Snippets

## Status

Draft

## User Story

As a developer referencing the documentation,
I want code snippets that are real-world, incremental, and tested,
so that I can confidently use them as a basis for my own work and avoid errors.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: docs/examples/, docs/user-guide.md, docs/api-reference.md
- Technology: Python, Sphinx/ReadTheDocs, Markdown/ReStructuredText
- Follows pattern: Step-by-step, runnable code samples
- Touch points: Code blocks in docs, example scripts, tutorial sections

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All major code snippets in the documentation are reviewed and refactored for clarity and accuracy
2. Snippets are organized to build on one another step-by-step
3. Each snippet is tested and confirmed to work as shown
4. Real-world use cases are prioritized in examples
5. Snippets are referenced from relevant tutorial and concept sections

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Audit all code snippets in documentation (AC: 1)
- [ ] Refactor snippets for clarity and incremental learning (AC: 1, 2)
- [ ] Test each snippet and update as needed (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add or update real-world examples (AC: 4)
- [ ] Cross-link snippets to tutorials and concepts (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes

- Use examples/ directory as the source of truth for tested code
- Prefer minimal, focused snippets that build up to full examples
- Ensure all code is up-to-date with the latest Fapilog API

## Testing

- Run all snippets in a clean environment
- Confirm output matches documentation
- Solicit feedback from users on clarity and usefulness
