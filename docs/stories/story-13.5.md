# Story 13.5 – Add Comprehensive Monitoring and Metrics

**Epic:** 13 – Architecture Improvements  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 8

**DEPRECATED: This story has been split into smaller, more manageable stories:**

- **Story 13.5a** - Implement Basic Metrics Collection System (5 points)
- **Story 13.5b** - Implement Health Check System and Prometheus Integration (3 points)
- **Story 13.5c** - Implement Advanced Monitoring and Alerting (3 points)

**Please use the split stories instead of this original story.**

───────────────────────────────────  
Original Acceptance Criteria

- Metrics collection for queue performance (size, throughput, latency)
- Metrics for sink performance (success rate, error rate, latency)
- Health check endpoints for monitoring systems
- Performance counters for log processing
- Memory usage monitoring for queue and sinks
- Error rate tracking and alerting capabilities
- Metrics export in Prometheus format
- Integration with common monitoring systems
- Real-time dashboard capabilities
- Comprehensive documentation for monitoring setup

───────────────────────────────────  
**CURRENT STATUS: DEPRECATED - Use split stories instead**

**Split Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 13.5a** - Basic metrics collection and Prometheus export
- ✅ **Story 13.5b** - Health check system and enhanced Prometheus integration
- ✅ **Story 13.5c** - Advanced monitoring, alerting, and dashboard capabilities

**Recommendation:** Implement the split stories in order (13.5a → 13.5b → 13.5c) for better manageability and testing.
