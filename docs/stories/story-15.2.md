# Story 2: Quickstart & Tutorials

## Status

Draft

## User Story

As a novice Fapilog user,
I want a hands-on, step-by-step tutorial that guides me from data ingestion through analysis to dashboarding,
so that I can quickly build a working app and understand the end-to-end workflow.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: docs/user-guide.md, docs/examples/, docs/index.rst
- Technology: Sphinx/ReadTheDocs, Python, Markdown/ReStructuredText
- Follows pattern: Real-world, incremental tutorials
- Touch points: Quickstart section, navigation sidebar, example code

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new "Quickstart" section is created and accessible from the main navigation
2. Tutorial guides users through a concrete app: ingestion → analysis → dashboard
3. Each step includes runnable, tested code snippets
4. Tutorial builds on itself, with each step referencing the previous
5. Common pitfalls and troubleshooting tips are included
6. Internal links to concept and reference sections are provided
