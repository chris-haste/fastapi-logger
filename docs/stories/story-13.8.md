# Story 13.8 – Add Performance Benchmarks and Optimization

**Epic:** 13 – Architecture Improvements  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 5

**DEPRECATED: This story has been split into smaller, more manageable stories:**

- **Story 13.8a** - Implement Basic Benchmark Framework and Load Testing (5 points)
- **Story 13.8b** - Implement Performance Monitoring and Profiling (3 points)
- **Story 13.8c** - Implement Optimization Utilities and Regression Testing (3 points)

**Please use the split stories instead of this original story.**

───────────────────────────────────  
Original Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive performance benchmarks for all components
- Load testing scenarios for different use cases
- Performance monitoring and profiling tools
- Optimization recommendations based on benchmarks
- Performance regression testing
- Memory usage optimization
- CPU usage optimization
- Network I/O optimization
- Performance documentation and guidelines
- Continuous performance monitoring

───────────────────────────────────  
**CURRENT STATUS: DEPRECATED - Use split stories instead**

**Split Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 13.8a** - Basic benchmark framework, load testing scenarios, and performance measurement
- ✅ **Story 13.8b** - Performance monitoring, profiling utilities, and bottleneck detection
- ✅ **Story 13.8c** - Optimization utilities, regression testing, and continuous monitoring

**Recommendation:** Implement the split stories in order (13.8a → 13.8b → 13.8c) for better manageability and testing.
