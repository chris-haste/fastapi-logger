# Story 14.2: Update PyPI Classification from Alpha to Beta

## 📋 Story Information

- **Story ID**: 14.2
- **Epic**: Documentation & Distribution
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 0.5 day (reduced due to completed version management work)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Status**: In Progress (Version management completed)

## 🎯 Objective

Update the PyPI package classification to reflect the current maturity level of the `fapilog` project, changing from "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha" to "Development Status :: 4 - Beta".

## 📝 Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **PyPI Classification Update**

   - Change `Development Status :: 3 - Alpha` to `Development Status :: 4 - Beta`
   - Update `pyproject.toml` with the new classifier
   - Ensure the change is reflected in the next package release

2. **Version Management** ✅ **COMPLETED**

   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Centralized version management in pyproject.toml
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Updated **init**.py to read version from pyproject.toml
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Eliminated version duplication between files
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Added comprehensive unit tests for version management
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Version is now single source of truth

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md to reflect beta status
   - Update any references to "alpha" or "experimental" status
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects current stability

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Consistency** ✅ **COMPLETED**

   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: All version references are now consistent (single source of truth)
   - Documentation must accurately reflect the new status
   - Release notes must clearly communicate the status change

2. **Communication**
   - Clear messaging about what "beta" means for users
   - Appropriate expectations set for stability and API changes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify

1. **Primary Changes**

   ```
   pyproject.toml                    # Update classifier and version
   README.md                         # Update status references
   ```

2. **Optional Updates**

   ```
   docs/user-guide.md               # Update any alpha references
   docs/api-reference.md            # Update any alpha references
   CHANGELOG.md                     # Document the status change
   ```

3. **Completed Changes** ✅
   ```
   src/fapilog/__init__.py          # ✅ COMPLETED: Dynamic version reading
   tests/test_version_management.py  # ✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive tests
   ```

### Specific Changes

1. **pyproject.toml**

   ```toml
   # Change from:
   "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha",

   # To:
   "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
   ```

2. **Version Update**

   ```toml
   # Update version (example):
   version = "0.2.0"  # or appropriate beta version
   ```

3. \***\*init**.py** ✅ **COMPLETED\*\*
   - Version is now automatically read from pyproject.toml
   - No manual version updates needed in **init**.py
   - Single source of truth for version management
   - Robust fallback mechanisms implemented

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases

1. **Package Build Testing**

   - [ ] `python -m build` completes successfully

   - [ ] No references to "alpha" or "experimental" remain
   - [ ] Version numbers are consistent

4. **Version Management Testing** ✅ **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: 13 comprehensive unit tests implemented
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: All tests passing
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fallback mechanisms tested
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Edge cases covered

## 📚 Beta Status Guidelines

### What Beta Means

- **API Stability**: APIs are mostly stable but may have minor changes
- **Feature Completeness**: Core features are implemented and tested
- **Production Readiness**: Suitable for production use with caution
- **Community Feedback**: Actively seeking user feedback and bug reports

### Communication Points

- Beta status indicates the project is feature-complete and stable
- APIs are expected to be stable with minor version updates
- Production use is supported with appropriate monitoring
- Community feedback is welcome and encouraged

## 🏷️ Labels

- `pypi`
- `version`
