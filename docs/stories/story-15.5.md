# Story 5: Internal Linking & Navigation

## Status

Draft

## User Story

As a documentation user,
I want rich internal linking, callouts, and a clear sidebar hierarchy,
so that I can easily navigate between related topics and always know where I am in the docs.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: docs/index.rst, docs/config, all documentation files
- Technology: Sphinx/ReadTheDocs, Markdown/ReStructuredText
- Follows pattern: Modern, navigable documentation
- Touch points: Sidebar, callouts, "See also" links, cross-references

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All major sections include "See also" callouts to related topics
2. Sidebar hierarchy is updated for logical flow: intro → tutorial → concept → reference
3. Cross-references are added throughout for easy navigation
4. Navigation is tested for usability and orientation
5. Internal links are maintained and do not break during doc updates

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add "See also" callouts to all major sections (AC: 1)
- [x] Update sidebar/toctree for new documentation flow (AC: 2)
- [x] Add cross-references between related topics (AC: 3)
- [x] Test navigation for usability and orientation (AC: 4)

## Dev Agent Record
