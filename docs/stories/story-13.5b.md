# Story 13.5b – Implement Health Check System and Prometheus Integration

**Epic:** 13 – Architecture Improvements  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 3

**As a library maintainer**  
I want to implement a comprehensive health check system with Prometheus integration  
So that monitoring systems can track the health and status of the logging system.

───────────────────────────────────  
Acceptance Criteria

- Health check system for queue and sink status
- Queue health monitoring (size, worker status, processing rate)
- Sink health monitoring (connectivity, error rates, response times)
- Overall system health status
- Health check endpoints for HTTP monitoring
- Prometheus integration with detailed metrics
- Health status reporting and alerting
- Comprehensive health check documentation

───────────────────────────────────  
Tasks / Technical Checklist

1. **Implement health check system in `src/fapilog/health.py`**:

   - `HealthChecker` class for health status
   - Queue health: size, worker status, processing rate
   - Sink health: connectivity, error rates, response times
   - Overall system health: configuration, initialization status
   - Health check endpoints for HTTP monitoring

2. **Enhance Prometheus exporter in `src/fapilog/monitoring.py`**:

   - Add health status metrics
   - Include detailed system metrics
   - Support custom metrics from users
   - Add metric labels and metadata

3. **Add health monitoring to queue worker**:

   - Health status reporting
   - Worker status monitoring
   - Queue overflow detection
   - Performance degradation detection

4. **Add health monitoring to sinks**:

   - Connectivity health checks
   - Response time monitoring
   - Error rate tracking
   - Sink status reporting

5. **Create health check endpoints**:

   - `/health` endpoint for basic health status
   - `/health/detailed` for detailed health information
   - `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus metrics
   - Health status JSON responses

6. **Add comprehensive health tests**:

   - Test health check functionality
   - Test Prometheus export format
   - Test health status reporting
   - Test error condition handling

7. **Update documentation**:
   - Health check setup guide
   - Prometheus integration guide
   - Health monitoring examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

───────────────────────────────────  
Dependencies / Notes

- Depends on Story 13.5a for basic metrics collection
- Should integrate with existing monitoring systems
- Health checks should be lightweight and fast
- Should provide actionable health information
