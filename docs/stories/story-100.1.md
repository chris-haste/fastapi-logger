# Story 100.1 – Parallel Enricher Processing Pipeline

**Epic:** 100 – Processing Performance Optimization  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 8

**As a performance-conscious developer**  
I want enrichers to execute in parallel when they have no dependencies  
So that log processing throughput increases by 2-3x for high-volume applications.

───────────────────────────────────  
Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Independent enrichers execute concurrently instead of sequentially
- [ ] Dependency resolution still respects enricher dependencies via topological sorting
- [ ] Parallel execution groups are determined automatically from dependency graph
- [ ] Error in one enricher doesn't block others in the same parallel group
- [ ] Circuit breaker protection applies to individual enrichers in parallel groups
- [ ] Performance metrics track parallel vs sequential execution times
- [ ] Timeout handling works correctly for parallel enricher groups
- [ ] Memory usage remains bounded during parallel processing
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing enricher configurations

Tasks / Technical Checklist

1. **Enhance dependency resolution in `src/fapilog/_internal/enricher_registry.py`**:

   - Extend `resolve_dependencies()` to return parallel execution groups
   - Group enrichers by dependency levels (level 0, level 1, etc.)
   - Maintain topological ordering within each level

2. **Update async pipeline in `src/fapilog/_internal/async_pipeline.py`**:

   - Replace sequential `for` loop with `asyncio.gather()` for parallel groups
   - Implement timeout handling per group rather than per enricher
   - Add error isolation between parallel enrichers

3. **Optimize sync enricher processing in `src/fapilog/pipeline.py`**:

   - Use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel sync enricher execution
   - Implement proper resource management for thread pools
   - Add configuration for max parallel enricher threads

4. **Add parallel processing metrics**:

   - Track execution time improvements from parallelization
   - Monitor resource usage during parallel execution
   - Add performance comparison metrics (parallel vs sequential)

5. **Update enricher registry caching**:

   - Cache parallel execution plans to avoid repeated dependency resolution
   - Invalidate cache when enricher configuration changes
   - Optimize for high-frequency enricher execution patterns

6. **Comprehensive testing**:

   - Test with various dependency graph configurations
   - Validate error isolation between parallel enrichers
   - Performance benchmarks comparing parallel vs sequential execution
   - Memory leak testing under high-concurrency scenarios

Dev Notes

**Current Bottleneck:**
```python
# Sequential processing in async_pipeline.py
for enricher in self._async_enrichers:
    result = await enricher(logger, method_name, result)
```

**Target Architecture:**
```python
# Parallel processing by dependency level
for level_enrichers in parallel_groups:
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[enricher(logger, method_name, result) for enricher in level_enrichers],
        return_exceptions=True
    )
    result = merge_enricher_results(results, result)
```

**Dependencies:**
- Existing enricher registry and dependency resolution
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Metrics collection system

**Performance Impact:**
- Expected 2-3x throughput improvement for applications with 3+ independent enrichers
- Reduced latency for high-volume logging scenarios
- Better resource utilization on multi-core systems

───────────────────────────────────
