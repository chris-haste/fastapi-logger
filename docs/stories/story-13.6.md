# Story 13.6 – Enhance Security Features with Advanced PII Detection and Validation

**Epic:** 13 – Architecture Improvements  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 8

**DEPRECATED: This story has been split into smaller, more manageable stories:**

- **Story 13.6a** - Implement Enhanced PII Detection and Validation (5 points)
- **Story 13.6b** - Implement URI Validation and SSRF Protection (3 points)
- **Story 13.6c** - Implement Rate Limiting and Content Validation (3 points)
- **Story 13.6d** - Implement Encryption and Compliance Features (3 points)

**Please use the split stories instead of this original story.**

───────────────────────────────────  
Original Acceptance Criteria

- Enhanced PII detection with more comprehensive patterns
- URI validation for sink configurations to prevent SSRF attacks
- Improved redaction robustness against encoding bypasses
- Content validation for log structure and size limits
- Rate limiting capabilities to prevent log flooding
- Audit trails for redaction operations
- Encryption support for sensitive log data
- Compliance features for GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA
- Security configuration validation
- Comprehensive security documentation

───────────────────────────────────  
**CURRENT STATUS: DEPRECATED - Use split stories instead**

**Split Stories:**

- ✅ **Story 13.6a** - Enhanced PII detection with international formats and fuzzy matching
- ✅ **Story 13.6b** - URI validation and SSRF protection for sink configurations
- ✅ **Story 13.6c** - Rate limiting and content validation for log flooding prevention
- ✅ **Story 13.6d** - Encryption and compliance features for enterprise requirements

**Recommendation:** Implement the split stories in order (13.6a → 13.6b → 13.6c → 13.6d) for better manageability and testing.
