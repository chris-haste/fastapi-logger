Story 9.1 – CI Setup: GitHub Actions for Lint, Type, Test  
───────────────────────────────────  
Epic: 9 – Developer Experience & CI  
Sprint Target: Sprint #⟪next⟫  
Story Points: 5  
Status: ✅ COMPLETED

**As a contributor to the fapilog library**  
I want automatic linting, type-checking, and test execution via GitHub Actions  
So that code quality is enforced and regressions are caught early.

───────────────────────────────────  
Acceptance Criteria

- A GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push and PR to `main` and `feature/**` branches
- The workflow runs `hatch run lint`, `hatch run typecheck`, and `hatch run test`
- Results are clearly reported in the GitHub UI
- Failures block merging to `main`
- Workflow supports Python 3.11 (default)
- Badge is added to the README showing CI status
- Workflow uses GitHub-hosted runners (ubuntu-latest)
- If tox is present, a second job optionally runs `tox` to validate compatibility

───────────────────────────────────  
Tasks / Technical Checklist

1. Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the following jobs:

   - **Build & Lint:**
     - `python-version: 3.11`
     - steps:
       - checkout
       - setup Python
       - install Hatch
       - run: `hatch run lint`
   - **Type Check:**
     - run: `hatch run typecheck`
   - **Test:**
     - run: `hatch run test`

2. Optionally add `tox` job:

   - matrix for `py311`
   - run `tox -q`

3. Update README with badge (as a code block, not rendered):

   - Add the following under the title section:
     ```md
     ![CI](https://github.com/<org>/fastapi-logger/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
     ```

4. Ensure workflow triggers on:

   - `push` to `main`
   - `pull_request` to `main`
   - `feature/**` branches

5. Commit `.github/` to source control
6. Validate CI runs successfully on PR

───────────────────────────────────  
Dependencies / Notes

- CI should assume local `.venv` is not present; fresh installs required
- CI linting/type/test must match local `hatch` behavior
- No deployment or publish logic included (separate story)
