# Contributing to fapilog

Thank you for your interest in contributing to fapilog! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributors to help ensure a smooth development process.

> **Project Naming**: This project is developed in the `fastapi-logger` repository but published to PyPI as `fapilog`. The repository name is descriptive of the project's purpose, while the package name is concise and memorable.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- pip (Python package installer)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chris-haste/fastapi-logger.git
   cd fastapi-logger
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Verify the setup**
   ```bash
   hatch run test
   ```

### Development Dependencies

The project uses several development tools that are automatically installed with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`:

- **pytest** - Testing framework
- **ruff** - Linting and code formatting
- **mypy** - Type checking
- **pytest-cov** - Coverage reporting
- **pre-commit** - Git hooks for code quality
- **vulture** - Dead code detection
- **hatch** - Project management and build tool

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

Always work on feature branches, never directly on `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines when writing code:

- **Follow PEP 8** - Use the project's Ruff configuration for consistent formatting
- **Add type hints** - All new functions should include type annotations
- **Write tests** - New features should include comprehensive tests
- **Update documentation** - Keep README.md and docstrings up to date

### 3. Run Quality Checks

Before committing, ensure your code passes all quality checks:

```bash
# Run linting
hatch run lint

# Run type checking
hatch run typecheck

# Run tests
hatch run test

# Run tests with coverage
hatch run test-cov
```

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to automatically check code quality:

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (first time only)
pre-commit install

# Run manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The hooks will run automatically on staged files when you commit. They include:

- **Ruff** - Linting and code formatting
- **MyPy** - Type checking
- **Vulture** - Dead code detection

### 5. Update CHANGELOG.md

For any user-facing changes, add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under the `[Unreleased]` section:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New feature description

### Changed

- Changed behavior description

### Fixed

- Bug fix description
```

Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format.

## Commit & PR Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new Loki sink for log shipping"
git commit -m "fix: handle invalid configuration gracefully"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"
git commit -m "chore(release): v0.1.1"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a PR** from your feature branch to `main`
2. **Ensure CI passes** - All GitHub Actions checks must pass
3. **Add a description** explaining what the PR does and why
4. **Link related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"
5. **Request review** from maintainers

**PR Title Format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

**Examples:**

- `feat(sinks): add new file sink with rotation`
- `fix(middleware): handle missing trace headers`
- `docs(readme): add contributing guidelines`

### Code Review Guidelines

- **Be respectful** and constructive in feedback
- **Focus on the code** and its impact
- **Suggest improvements** rather than just pointing out issues
- **Test the changes** locally if possible

## Release Process

### Versioning

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Steps

1. **Update version** in `pyproject.toml`
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** - Move entries from `[Unreleased]` to new version section
3. **Commit changes** with message `chore(release): vX.Y.Z`
4. **Create and push tag** - `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`
5. **Build artifacts** - `python -m build`
6. **Upload to PyPI** (if applicable)

For detailed release instructions, see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Test new features** - Every new feature should have tests
- **Test edge cases** - Include tests for error conditions
- **Use descriptive names** - Test names should explain what they test
- **Keep tests simple** - Each test should test one thing
- **Use fixtures** - Reuse common test setup with pytest fixtures

```python
def test_feature_name():
    """Test description of what this test verifies."""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert
```

```bash
# Run all tests
hatch run test

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests with coverage
hatch run test-cov

# Run tests matching pattern
pytest -k "test_name_pattern"
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code

- **Follow PEP 8** - Use the project's Ruff configuration
- **Use type hints** - All functions should have type annotations
- **Write docstrings** - Document public functions and classes
- **Keep functions small** - Aim for single responsibility
- **Use meaningful names** - Variables and functions should be descriptive

### Import Organization
